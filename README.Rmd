# **multiSight** 

:rocket: This document is built to be efficient as quickly as 
possible with **multiSight**.

- The goal of **multiSight** is to handle multi-omic data and network inference
in a easy-to-use R shiny package.

> You could use this tool with a graphical interface or only with 
script functions (see **Vignette** and *manual* for detailed examples).

# Installation

You can install the released version of **multiSight** from
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#To install this package ensure you have BiocManager installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

#The following initializes usage of Bioc devel
BiocManager::install("multiSight")

# To get up-to-date package
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Fjeanneret/multiSight")
```

# What is **multiSight** ?

**multiSight** is a R package providing an user-friendly graphical interface to 
analyze and explore your omic data sets in a __multi-omic__ manner by _DESEQ2_ 
(see **Biological Insights tab**), machine learning methods with _biosigner_ 
and _multi-block statistical analysis_ (see **Classification tab**) helped by
_p-values pooling Stouffer's_ method.

For each omic data set you furnish, it provides _**classification models**_ 
with *feature selection* you can use as biosignature:

- To forecast phenotypes (e.g. to diagnostic tasks, histological subtyping)
- To design _**Pathways**_ and _**gene ontology**_ **enrichments**
- To build _**Network inference**_ linked to _**PubMed**_ querying to make 
assumptions easier and data-driven.

# :newspaper: App

**multiSight** enables you to get better biological insights for each omic dataset 
helping by __four analytic modules__ which content:

- :memo: __Data input__ & __results__;
- :dart: __Classification__ models building;
- :books: __Biological databases__ querying;
- :seedling: __Network Inference__ & __Pubmed__ querying.

> :point_right: Run the application

```{r}
# run_app()
```

# What kind of data ? 

All types of omic data respecting input format is supported to build 
**classification models**, **biosignatures** selection and
**network inference**.

- Genomics;
- Transcriptomics;
- Proteomics;
- Metabolomics;
- Lipidomics;

> :point_right: In fact all numeric matrices.

## Data inputs formats

You have to provide two types of data: **numeric matrices** and 
**classes vector** as csv tables for all **same samples**.

| Omic data 1 |        |        |        |     |

# :dart: Classification tab

Two types of models have been implemented so far to answer different 
questions: **Biosigner** & **Diablo**.

- To determine *small biosignatures* - Biosigner.
- To build *classification models* in a *multi-omic* way - Diablo.
- To select relevant biological *features* to *enrich* - Diablo.

| Features selected                             | Performances                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|

# :books: Biological insights tab

**Biological Insight** tab is dedicated to give biological sense to your data. 

- You could process ___2 analysis in 2 clicks___: *DESEQ2* and 
*Diablo features* enrichments.

## Biological Annotation Databases

**multiSight** uses so far **several databases** to provide large panel of 
**enrichment analysis** automatically after few clicks:

**Pathways** and **Gene Ontology** databases are implemented, helped by 
**clusterProfiler** and **reactomePA** R Bioconductor packages.

- Kegg;
- Reactome;
- wikiPathways;
- Molecular Function (GO)
- Cellular Component (GO)
- Biological Process (GO)

## Visualizations

Two types of result visualization are given:

- Classical **Enrichment table** for each omic and each database (e.g. 
Pathways id, p-value, padjust columns).
- And, when more than one omic enriched: *Multi-omic table* and *multi-omic
enrichment map* for **DESEQ2** and *Diablo selected features*

| DESEQ2 & Diablo features                    | Enrichment tables                            | Enrichment Map                                |

# :seedling: Assumption tab

> :point_right: Some clicks (from 4 to number of pubmed queries)

**Assumption tab** aims to help biological hypothesis making by *network 
inference* with feature relation values (e.g correlation, partial correlation)
and *PubMed module* linked to relation tables.

Tools:

- To compute _*network inference*_ and reveal feature relationships.
- To get _*Pubmed articles*_ based on your personalized query without leaving 
app.

# :checkered_flag: Results

You could retrieve different results computed by multiSight in Home tab by:

- Automatic report with all results in **HTML** and **.doc** documents.
- **.RData** with all results obtained by all modules.

Note that tables could be download in a separated way in relative tabs.

> **MODELS**: Classification models you can use on future data.

> **DESEQ2** Differential expression analysis tables.

> **BIOSIGNATURES**: DESEQ2's tables thresholding and diablo multi-omic features 
selection method

> **Functional ENRICHMENTS**: 6 databases functional enrichment for all omic 
data sets you provide enriched by Stouffer's pooling p-value method giving 
a **multi-omic enrichmentt able** easily to discuss.

> **NETWORKS**: network inference with all features selected from all omic 
datasets according to DESEQ2 tables thresholding or multi-omic feature 
selection (correlation, partial correlation, mutual information).

> **BIBLIOGRAPHY** : Subset of pubMed articles relative to relations you choose 
in network inference tab.
