Description: 'multiSight' is a R package providing an user-friendly graphical interface to analyze your 'omic' data sets in a __'multi-omic'__ manner based Stouffer's p-value pooling and multi-block statistical methods.
    For each 'omic' data set you furnish, multiSight provides classification models with feature selection you can use as 'biosignature':
    - To forecast phenotypes (e.g. to diagnostic tasks, histological 'subtyping')
    - To design Pathways and gene ontology 'enrichments' (Over Representation Analysis)
    - To build Network inference linked to 'PubMed' querying to make assumptions easier and data-driven.
